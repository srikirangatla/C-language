Bootloader in Embedded Systems
A bootloader is a small program that runs when a microcontroller or embedded system is powered on or reset. Its primary purpose is to load the main application or operating system into memory and hand over execution control to it. Bootloaders are essential for embedded systems that need firmware updates or multi-stage initialization.

Key Functions of a Bootloader:
System Initialization: Sets up the hardware peripherals, clocks, memory, and initializes essential hardware components (e.g., flash memory, RAM, UART).
Firmware Update: Provides the capability to update the application firmware, often over communication interfaces like UART, USB, Ethernet, or even wirelessly.
Integrity Check: Validates the integrity of the application code (e.g., through CRC or digital signatures) before executing it.
Boot Mode Selection: May allow selection between different boot modes (e.g., normal boot or recovery mode).

Explanation of the Bootloader Stages:
Power On / System Reset:

When the system is powered on or reset, the bootloader is the first piece of software that starts executing.
Bootloader Start:

This is the initial phase where the bootloader is invoked. It typically resides in a protected section of flash memory or ROM so that it cannot be overwritten by the application.
Hardware Initialization:

The bootloader configures essential hardware, including setting up the system clock, enabling memory interfaces, initializing GPIOs, and setting up communication interfaces (like UART, USB, etc.) that may be used to load new firmware.
Check for Firmware Update Request:

The bootloader checks whether a new firmware update is requested. This can be done by reading a special flag, checking a specific memory location, or receiving a request through a communication interface (e.g., from a host via UART or USB).
Perform Firmware Update (if requested):

If a firmware update is requested, the bootloader enters firmware update mode. The new firmware image is received over the selected interface and written to flash memory.
Validate Application Code Integrity:

If no firmware update is required, the bootloader checks the validity and integrity of the application code (this can be done via checksums like CRC, hash functions, or digital signatures) to ensure that it has not been corrupted.
Launch Application Code:

Once the application code is validated, the bootloader passes control to the application by jumping to the application's entry point. This effectively starts the main application running on the microcontroller.
Reboot System:

If a firmware update was performed, the bootloader may reboot the system to ensure the new firmware runs from a clean state.
Types of Bootloaders:
Primary Bootloader:

It is executed immediately after the reset or power-on. It typically resides in ROM or a secure section of flash memory. Its responsibility is to perform basic hardware initialization and possibly load a secondary bootloader.
Secondary Bootloader:

This bootloader is loaded by the primary bootloader and is more sophisticated, offering features like loading an operating system, application, or handling updates.
Advantages of a Bootloader:
Remote Firmware Updates:

With a bootloader, you can remotely update the system firmware, reducing the need for physical access to the device. This is crucial for IoT and large-scale embedded deployments.
Application Integrity Check:

Bootloaders ensure that the application is not corrupted by verifying checksums or cryptographic signatures.
Multiple Boot Modes:

Bootloaders can provide multiple boot modes, such as recovery mode (for re-flashing faulty applications), diagnostic mode, or normal boot.
Fail-safe Mechanisms:

Bootloaders often implement fail-safe mechanisms where, if an update fails or the application is corrupted, the bootloader can revert to a known good state or request a new firmware update.
Example Use Case: MCU Bootloader
An MCU might have a bootloader that listens for a new firmware image over a UART connection. When new firmware is available, the bootloader receives the binary data, writes it into flash memory, and verifies the integrity of the data before rebooting the system to run the updated application.
