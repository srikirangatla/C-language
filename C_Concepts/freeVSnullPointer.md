In C programming, there is a difference between calling free() and simply assigning NULL to a dynamic memory pointer. Let's break down what each action does and how they differ in their effects on memory management.

1. free()
Purpose: free() is used to deallocate memory that was dynamically allocated using malloc(), calloc(), or realloc(). This memory is returned to the heap and made available for future allocations.
Effect:
Marks the allocated memory as free, allowing the operating system or memory manager to use that memory for future allocations.
Does not erase the actual contents of the memory block.
Does not modify the pointer value itself (the pointer still points to the memory block that has been freed).
Accessing memory after calling free() leads to undefined behavior, since the memory is no longer reserved.
Example:

c
Copy code
int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10); // Allocates memory for 10 integers
free(ptr);                           // Deallocates the memory
After calling free(), the memory pointed to by ptr is no longer valid, but ptr still contains the address of the now-invalid memory block.
2. Assigning NULL
Purpose: Assigning NULL to a pointer is typically done to reset the pointer after freeing the memory it pointed to. It helps avoid accidental dereferencing of a pointer that no longer points to valid memory (i.e., a dangling pointer).
Effect:
It only changes the value of the pointer. The pointer now points to NULL, which is a special pointer value representing "no memory" or an invalid memory address.
Does not deallocate any memory. If you only assign NULL to a pointer without calling free(), the memory previously allocated remains allocated and can lead to a memory leak.
Example:

c
Copy code
int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10); // Allocates memory for 10 integers
ptr = NULL;                          // The pointer now points to NULL, but the memory is not freed!
In this case, memory is still allocated even though ptr no longer points to it, resulting in a memory leak.
Difference between free() and Assigning NULL
Aspect	free()	Assigning NULL
Memory Deallocation	Yes, it releases the dynamically allocated memory back to the system or heap.	No, it does not release memory; it only changes the pointer value.
Pointer Value	Does not change the pointer value; it still points to the original (now invalid) memory.	Changes the pointer value to NULL, but the memory remains allocated if free() was not called first.
Prevention of Dangling Pointer	No, unless you also set the pointer to NULL after calling free().	Yes, but it can lead to memory leaks if not used correctly (without free()).
Common Use Case	Used to free dynamically allocated memory.	Used to reset the pointer after memory has been freed, to prevent accidental dereferencing.
Risk of Memory Leak	No, unless free() is not called at all.	Yes, if used without free(), it causes a memory leak (the allocated memory is lost and cannot be freed).
Correct Usage: free() + Assigning NULL
A common best practice in C programming is to use both free() and then assign NULL to the pointer to avoid issues like dangling pointers and accidental memory access:

Example:

c
Copy code
int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);  // Allocate memory for 10 integers

free(ptr);   // Deallocate the memory
ptr = NULL;  // Set the pointer to NULL to avoid a dangling pointer
free(ptr): This deallocates the memory.
ptr = NULL: This ensures that the pointer does not point to the invalid memory, avoiding accidental dereferencing of a dangling pointer.
Consequences of Not Using free():
Memory Leaks: If you assign NULL to a pointer without calling free(), the allocated memory is not released, leading to memory leaks, especially in long-running programs.
Dangling Pointer: If you call free() but do not set the pointer to NULL, the pointer still holds the memory address of the freed memory, which can lead to undefined behavior if it is dereferenced.
Summary:
free() releases dynamically allocated memory back to the system, but the pointer still holds the old memory address (dangling pointer).
Assigning NULL to a pointer after free() helps avoid dereferencing a dangling pointer but does not release memory on its own.
A combination of free() followed by assigning NULL is the best practice to ensure both memory is deallocated and the pointer is safely reset.
